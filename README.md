## Census Bureau's Perceived Benefits
The permit microdata would benefit operations in the Decennial, Demographic, and Economic Directorates within the [Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/about/what.html), and support information needs in other Departments. 

### Economic Directorate
The information would have significant impact in the Economic Directorate to decrease costs, improve quality, and provide new data products, including:
-	Eliminating the need for [BPS](http://www.census.gov/construction/bps/) **data collection**
-	Eliminating the need for [SOC](http://www.bls.gov/soc/) listing operations
-	Improving the **accuracy** of the SOC and [SOMA](http://www.census.gov/housing/soma/) samples
-	Improving the accuracy of the sub-county **housing unit** and **population** estimates
-	Providing data on **demolitions** to improve studies of changes in the housing stock
-	Providing the ability to release zip code level data and maps on residential and nonresidential **construction** for selected areas
-	Providing data on nonresidential permits to replace the Nonresidential Coverage Evaluation listing operation and/or to supplement the [Dodge](http://analyticsstore.construction.com/index.php) frame for the Construction Progress Reporting Survey 

### Decennial and Demographic Directorates
The information would improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of operations in Decennial and Demo by: 
-	Providing detailed **address** information for new housing units to update the Master Address File (MAF)
-	Reducing the need for **address** canvassing for the decennial Census
-	Could support Decennial new/hidden unit detection
-	Increase the utility of purchase third party data on parcel numbers, deeds, and foreclosures
-	Improving the accuracy of **American Housing Survey weighting** based on the SOC

The pilot offers opportunities to collaborate with government and private organizations.  Information could be shared with planners, policy makers, and analysts in state and local governments, other Departments, and private organizations.  HUDâ€™s Office of Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs (ODAS/EA) interest in permits and **Low Income Housing** Tax Credits (LIHTC), and the Housing and Demographic Analysis Division (also under ODAS/EA) is interested in **green buildings** and **disability accessibility** that could be gleaned from text on permits.  We anticipate interest from DOT, USGS, Interior, and other Departments.  Through the pilot, we could engage with the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (IBTS), an organization that aids local governments on building code compliance, to develop a standard set of reporting formats.  The IBTS may also support our communication efforts and encourage jurisdictions to participate.
