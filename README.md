## Census Bureau's Perceived Benefits
The permit microdata would benefit operations in the Decennial, Demographic, and Economic Directorates within the [Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/about/what.html), and support information needs in other Departments. 

### Economic Directorate
The information would have significant impact in the Economic Directorate to decrease costs, improve quality, and provide new data products, including:
-	Eliminating the need for [BPS](http://www.census.gov/construction/bps/) **data collection**
-	Eliminating the need for [SOC](http://www.bls.gov/soc/) listing operations
-	Improving the **accuracy** of the SOC and [SOMA](http://www.census.gov/housing/soma/) samples
-	Improving the accuracy of the sub-county **housing unit** and **population** estimates
-	Providing data on **demolitions** to improve studies of changes in the housing stock
-	Providing the ability to release zip code level data and maps on residential and nonresidential **construction** for selected areas
-	Providing data on nonresidential permits to replace the Nonresidential Coverage Evaluation listing operation and/or to supplement the [Dodge](http://analyticsstore.construction.com/index.php) frame for the Construction Progress Reporting Survey 

### Decennial and Demographic Directorates
The information would improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of operations in Decennial and Demo by: 
-	Providing detailed **address** information for new housing units to update the Master Address File (MAF)
-	Reducing the need for **address** canvassing for the decennial Census
-	Could support Decennial new/hidden unit detection
-	Increase the utility of purchase third party data on parcel numbers, deeds, and foreclosures
-	Improving the accuracy of **American Housing Survey weighting** based on the SOC

The pilot offers opportunities to collaborate with government and private organizations.  Information could be shared with planners, policy makers, and analysts in state and local governments, other Departments, and private organizations.  HUD’s Office of Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs (ODAS/EA) interest in permits and **Low Income Housing** Tax Credits (LIHTC), and the Housing and Demographic Analysis Division (also under ODAS/EA) is interested in **green buildings** and **disability accessibility** that could be gleaned from text on permits.  We anticipate interest from DOT, USGS, Interior, and other Departments.  Through the pilot, we could engage with the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (IBTS), an organization that aids local governments on building code compliance, to develop a standard set of reporting formats.  The IBTS may also support our communication efforts and encourage jurisdictions to participate. 

## Building Permit Data Sets
A quick easy read of the building permit data

### West

washington state

- seattle

> "Seattle is a major port city that has a history of boom and bust.... most recently, the **boom** based on Microsoft and other software, web, and telecommunications companies, such as Amazon.com, AT&T Wireless, and RealNetworks.... also... Starbucks.... Nordstrom....".

> "Those coming into the city are usually shocked at the **prices** and **limited availability** of housing in the city.... Anyone visiting the city cannot help but notice the large number of people with shopping carts on the street."

### Central

illinois
- 2009+
  - bldg
  - air emissions permits
- chicago 2006+
  - bldg
  - daley center plaza event permits

> **disparity**: "A New York Times analysis of homicides and census data in Chicago compared areas near murders to those that were not. Residents living near homicides in the last 12 years were much more likely to be black, earn less money and lack a college degree."

missouri
- 1970+

> "Ferguson, which gets its name from a 19th-century farmer who donated a portion of his land for a railroad line and depot, is a suburb of St. Louis with just over 21,200 residents, 67 percent of whom are black. In 1970, the suburb was 99 percent white. For skeptics who wonder what that has to do with anything, **racial makeup** does make a difference, especially considering the spark that ignited such intense civil unrest came when an unarmed 18-year-old black youth was shot to death by a white police officer. It is a scenario that historically, over the last 50 years at least, has brought not just outrage but wholesale riots in cities across the country, accompanied by looting and burning of businesses. So it was after the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson."

### East

maryland
- 2000+
- baltimore
  - bldg
  - bldg work exceeding 50K
  - minor privilege permits (minor public space encroachment)

> "despite its proximity to the nation’s capital in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Maryland has been the center of economic despair and **urban blight** since riots rolled through the city a day after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. So great are the problems in modern-day Baltimore, that the city’s Black Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said in March that issues essentially 'go back in time.' 'When I go to Baltimore, on the East Coast, I’m dealing with 1950s-level black-and-white racism,' Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, according to the Sun. 'It’s taken a step back. Everything’s either black or everything’s white, and we’re dealing with that as a community.'”


massachusetts
- somerville (boston suburb)
- boston
  - bldg
  - public works, transportation, fire
  - asbestos removal
  - alcohol licenses

> **sprawl**: "If all of Boston's urbanization were a single urban area, it would be the third most expansive in the world [behind New York and Tokyo]... **urban renewal**: The core city of Boston is among the most dense in the United States, with a 2014 density of 13,300 per square mile (5,200 per square kilometer). It is also very successful, having experienced a strong population turnaround, after falling from 801,000 residents in 1950 to 562,000 in 1980 (a 30% loss). By 2014, the city had recovered nearly 40% of its former population, rising to 656,000."
